More links for you to read and share today. Including additional commentary from my as I tend to like to brattle on about things and this gives me another outlet.

## Today's Links

**[Can anything be done to assuage rural rage?](https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/can-anything-be-done-to-assuage-rural-rage/)** 

Paul Krugman gives an American perspective on this but the issue also pertains to Canada and, especially, to Alberta where I live. Our provincial politics are riven with this type of complaint.

**[Meet Sam Altman: OpenAI CEO, Prepper, Silicon Valley Royalty](https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-chatgpt-openai-ceo-career-net-worth-ycombinator-prepper-2023-1#altman-is-still-interested-in-nuclear-fusion-and-gave-helion-energy-375-million-last-year-28)**

I don't know if Business Insider was trying to make Altman look like an impressive business leader but he comes across in this article (perhaps just to me) as the typical rich techbro who got his start because of his parent's money and has turned into a weird creep. 

**[Montreal's No. 1 restaurant on Tripadvisor didn't really exist.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-fake-restaurant-tripadvisor-1.6733629)**

I am not sure if there was an actual endgame to this scam but the most popular restaurant in Montreal, according to Tripadvisor, didn't exist. The article is slightly amusing but misses the obvious point that this is the result of the concentration of users into sites that have to/want to automate all of their submissions. 

**[Pluralistic: Netflix wants to chop down your family tree ](https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/02/nonbinary-families/#red-envelopes)**

Cory Doctorow takes about how irrational belief in the power of software can't deal with the reality of most communities and families.  He also shares some interesting anecdotes about the forced evolution of his family's name after moving from Europe. 

**[Predatory community](https://blog.mollywhite.net/predatory-community/)**

Molly White is a very good writer and also knows crypto better than most people. What is often missed is that she is an engaging writer even when doing longer writing projects. What is worse that CryptoBros swindling people? The same asshats creating false communities to lure in unsuspecting people into crypto and NFT scams. 

**[US pension funds are on the brink of implosion â€“ and Wall Street is ignoring it ](https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2023/feb/02/us-pension-funds-implosion-wall-street-private-equity)**

Not even our pensions are safe. How long are people going to let politicians line the pockets of their backers at our expense. This is a very frightening look at the possible plight of pensions after pension funds managers got away with overvaluing their purchases. 

[Why Does It Feel Like Amazon Is Making Itself Worse?](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/01/why-does-it-feel-like-amazon-is-making-itself-worse.html)

A different take on the enshittification of Amazon. Looking at how the company has moved from being a store to largely being a distributor for other brands. Brands that sell a lot of poor products or fakes. 

Nothing new in general but the focus on looking at Amazon becoming a "storefront as a service" vendor is interesting.
