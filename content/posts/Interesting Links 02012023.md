This is just something that I am trying out. Mostly to be able to post comments about interesting articles but also to see what it is that I need to do to create a workflow to support doing this type of post. 

## Today's links

**[How Hollywood is breaking the VFX industry](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/hollywood-vfx-industry-breaking-point)**

This was posted by [Kieron Gillen](https://mastodon.social/@kierongillen) on Mastodon. It is a very interesting read for many reasons. This has been a problem in the VFX industry for close to 20 years and seems to be getting worse. Many of the examples in the article seem to be examples of executives interfering in projects to simply assert their authority and there being no way for anyone to tell them to fuck off. 

**[I grew up evangelical. Terrifying rapture films scarred me for ever](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/rapture-films-left-behind-evangelical)** 

I am not an evangelical nor was I ever but I am aware of this material. I spent a summer, when I was 14, staying with some relatives and the "corner" store that was two miles down the road was run by evangelicals who filled their comic rack with rapture comics including a very nicely done graphic novel that I spent the summer reading and rereading. This was before the Left Behind books which sound terrifying and the new Kevin Sorbo movie which sounds terrifying but in a different sense. 

**[20 Years a Blogger](https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd)**

Cory Doctorow explains the process he goes through to create his blog posts/Twitter threads/Mastodon threads. It is an interesting mix of tech-geekery and something more akin to glueing Samizdat posters together on your kitchen table. He has a process now that is more automated but when I asked him about his initial workflow he said that is was a result of "a lack of time, and the variability of the services, which would require constant refactoring". I think anyone who has spent multiple hours to automate a three second task will understand that.

**[Spoiler Alert History: No Alarms and No Surprises, Please](https://tedium.co/2023/02/01/spoiler-alert-history/)**

Dayten Rose talks about spoilers. The concept, the possible origin and issues surrounding them.
