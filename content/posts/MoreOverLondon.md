{{< alignimg OverLondon.jpg left>}} I have finally wound my way to the end of [OverLondon](https://www.overlondon.net/) and have been happily surprised by the book. You can check out my initial comments in [this earlier post](/posts/overlondon/). OverLondon is a comic-fantasy novel [^1] where steampunk scientific advances and genetic variability have turned the historical Europe into a mad setting. OverLondon is a funny book but, as amusing as it is, the true joy of the book is just how well it is constructed. 

All authors try to tell a story. Good authors are able to create that story but also guide the reader through it. They know when to answer the questions a reader will have and reveal those answers pages after the reader thinks of them. This is tricky enough in a normal story but it is even more difficult in a mystery. Penney and Johnson have a knack for navigating this and making the journey through their book seem more of a discovery than an exposition. This is something that is doubly important for a mystery. You want to see incongruities in the story that make you think about a solution to the crime but not have it so obvious that it spoils the story [^2].




[^1]: As with a lot of English terms it doesn't mean "swords and sorcery" as much as it means "fantastic".
[^2]: For a great example of this check out Battlefield Earth [^3].
[^3]: Actually don't. It is a horrible book.
