## Conservatives introduce law to protect vulnerable women

The Conservative Party of Canada announced, [on their website](https://www.conservative.ca/conservatives-introduce-law-to-protect-vulnerable-women/), the addition of a Private Member's Bill by MP Cathay Wagantall.  The Bill has numerous statistical errors and also appears to be yet another attempt my a Conservative Party MP to push anti-abortion legislation under the guise of trying to stand up to crime. 

## The announcement

> **OTTAWA, ON** — Cathay Wagantall [^1], Member of Parliament for Yorkton-Melville, today introduced her private Members’ bill, the _Violence Against Pregnant Women Act_, in the House of Commons.

> Today, MP Wagantall introduced Bill C-311 [^2], which adds two new aggravating factors to the Criminal Code of Canada. The crimes of knowingly assaulting a pregnant woman and causing physical or emotional harm to a pregnant woman will be considered by judges for their severity during the sentencing process [^3].

> “Conservatives are addressing the real threat of violence against women in Canada who have been left behind after 8 years of Trudeau’s soft-on-crime policies,” [^a] said MP Wagantall. “Trudeau’s crime wave [^b] has had serious impacts on women. Since Trudeau became Prime Minister, violent crime has increased by 32% [^4] [^4b] and gang killings have gone up by 92%. [^4c] [^5] [^6] Intimate partner violence has steadily increased each year for the past 7 years (no citation provided) [^7] and 8 in 10 victims of that crime are women. [^8]”

> The _Violence Against Pregnant Women Act_ follows more than eighty cases in recent Canadian history of women who have been killed by men who knew they were pregnant. [^4d]

> “Women are at a greater risk of intimate partner violence when pregnant, [^4e] but the consequences their attackers currently face do not reflect the crimes committed,” [^9] said Wagantall. “Sentences issued by our courts should match the crime. Conservatives are introducing this bill to ensure that criminals who attack or kill a pregnant woman can be sentenced appropriately by our courts.” [^10]

## Comments

It is of questionable taste to use the continued problem of violence against women as a way to score political points against the current Liberal government. Especially when the Bill in question doesn't necessarily do anything to change sentencing guidelines as they exist today. The Bill seeks to add the following to Criminal Code section 718.2

- (ii.‍2) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a person whom the offender knew to be pregnant,
- (ii.‍3) evidence that the offence caused physical or emotional harm to a pregnant victim,

Section ii of 718.2 already states:

- (ii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender’s intimate partner or a member of the victim or the offender’s family,

So two unanswered questions are: how does these additions to 718.2 actually change the sentencing guidelines and why are they needed. The MP offers no statistics to show increased violence against pregnant women. Nor do they offer any explanation of how adding two sentencing guidelines will protect pregnant women.

Also unanswered is why the MP wants to focus on pregnant women when the issue of Intimate Partner violence is still severe. Without an answer to this question it looks as if this Private Member's Bill is an indirect way to sneak in discussion of abortion. 

Also, what does gang violence have to do with any of this?

Almost every statistic in this announcement is incorrect and there are no citations or statistics to back up the core assertion of her Bill that "Women are at a greater risk of intimate partner violence when pregnant". Additionally there are no statistics to illustrate her comment that "Women are at a greater risk of intimate partner violence when pregnant" or "consequences their attackers currently face do not reflect the crimes committed". Why does she stop posting numbers when she gets to the crux of her Bill?

The MP, or the people writing the release for her, are fudging the numbers they do have and using extraneous, and incorrect, figures about gang violence to try to "gin up" their argument. They don't have any actual figures to back up their contentions or perhaps they do but they don't help their case even when they fudge them.

The MP tried to pass a [similar Private Member's Bill](https://parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-225/first-reading) in 2016 that differed critically by trying to 

> which sought to add a new class of person, a "[preborn child](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus "Fetus")", into the [Criminal Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code_(Canada) "Criminal Code (Canada)") and make injuring or causing death to the [preborn child](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus "Fetus") while committing or attempting to commit another offence against a female person that the person knows is pregnant to be a separate offense.

So, trying to get a fetus declared as a "person" by using the Criminal Code. As such it is difficult to see this as they another attempt for the Conservative Party to continue to push their anti-abortion viewpoint by trying to make it sound as if they want to stop crime.
