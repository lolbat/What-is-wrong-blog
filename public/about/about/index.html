  <p>So what is this and why did I click the &lsquo;About&rsquo; link?</p>
<p>The world is a puzzling and sometimes terrifying place. This blog will not provide anything to help you with that. Despite the title there is almost no chance of there being posts about dogs or their inability to deal with the rigorous demands of modernity.</p>
<h2 id="thats-a-nice-dog-you-have-there">That&rsquo;s a nice dog you have there</h2>
<p>The cute photo of the dog is from reddit user u/Niffer13. Their user page is marked as 18+ so you canâ€™t view it without logging in to Reddit.</p>
<h2 id="the-author">The author</h2>
<p>Zac is a recovering multimedia and web application developer. He started writing code and building applications before there even was a Javascript. Or a web. He feels very old writing that.</p>
<p>The first language he used was 6502 assembly code on an Apple II+ that he borrowed from his neighbour. After that he started using Pascal on his college&rsquo;s mainframe system. He took a hiatus away from computers and programming while he pursued a degree in history and linguistics.</p>
<p>Soon after, finding that there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of work for people with history BAs he started doing design work. How he found himself working as a designer with no experience is another story. A few years of design work lead to opportunities in the developing field of multimedia where he suddenly found himself coding again. This time the language was Lingo which was used in Macromedia Director.</p>
<p>The CD-ROM and multimedia market took a fairly big crash but it was at the same time that the internet was starting to get a lot of attention from people with more money than brains. Amazing websites were built, exploded in popularity with investors, bought Super Bowl ads and then crashed. While all that was happening Zac was building content management systems with ColdFusion.</p>
<p>An inconvenient RSI took him out of the programming game for a while and Zac went back to freelancing and continued to create websites in PHP (<em>ugh</em>) and HTML. Then along came an interesting CMS called Wordpress and he was happy building websites using it. Even if it meant that he had to write PHP code. Along the way he even took time to write an online video editor for an educational company using Director which was subsequently killed by a performance bug in the Windows version of Quicktime. Ah, memories.</p>
<p>He then took more than a decade off to help take care of a set of delightful twins. This involved more dealing with poo than he was expecting and quite a lot of time building forts out of couch cushions. The twins are now in their teenage years and more than capable of taking care of themselves and so Zac has found that he has more time on his hands and has decided to take time to write articles about whatever random things come to his mind.</p>
<p>Zac has written reviews and articles for several computer and tabletop wargaming websites and was once shortlisted for &ldquo;The last person we&rsquo;d ever award a Booker to&rdquo; prizelist. When he was in university he wrote quite a lot of poetry, as one does, but learned his lesson and hasn&rsquo;t done any since.</p>
<p>When not walking his dog and writing introductions to his blog in the third-person, Zac enjoys boardgames, jazz, coffee and trying to figure out why the teens he shares a house with can&rsquo;t tidy up after themselves. Zac is not on Twitter or Facebook but you can find him on <a href="https://home.social/@lolzac">Mastodon</a> where he often posts and sometimes even manages to post something interesting. Zac is happily married but to the type of person who really wouldn&rsquo;t want to be associated with him publicly so he won&rsquo;t link to her blog.</p>

<p>This site is created using <a href="https://gohugo.io" title="Hugo starts with the letter H">Hugo</a> and is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>. The pages were written using <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a> and the site is maintained using <a href="https://nova.app">Nova</a>. Many Markdown writing tools were used depending on what the task is. All of the Hugo command line work is done using <a href="https://iterm2.com/index.html">iTerm</a> which is really a quite wonderful terminal app.</p>
