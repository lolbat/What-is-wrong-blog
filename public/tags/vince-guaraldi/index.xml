      <description>The mystery of Watch What Happens I am not as educated in music theory or the specifics of music composition as I would like. This often leads me to puzzles for which I don&amp;rsquo;t have the answers and which are, typically, too detailed for me to find answers online.

First though, if you will indulge me, a brief tangent as I explain how I even started listening to this piece.</description>
