      <title>Preflight rework</title>

      <description>I did a fair bit of work on my preflight app/command last night. Primarily it was to add an argument to the command line to allow the user to add config data to the code so it knows where the user&amp;rsquo;s Hugo installation is.
I was reading through the Python Docs for argparse options as I was trying to make sure that the code would display help even if it was missing configuration data.</description>

      <description>I spent yesterday, and a bit of today, doing some work on my blog to add some tweaks to a few features that had been irritating me but clearly not enough to have done anything about it sooner. The recent posts list is now in a smaller font size and has bullets to make each post distinct.</description>

      <description>The last few days have been taken up with work on my Textual app - Victor. I mentioned it in my last post and I have been typing away getting new features included. This is how the app currently looks.
The app will read in the path to your local Hugo install and then read through the content directory looking for Markdown files.</description>

      <description>I have continued to work on my Preflight script over the last day or two. After I posted about it I changed the output using the Rich library to add some command line pizzaz to it.
The new layout uses the Box layout object in Rich to draw an ASCII style box around the output.</description>

      <description>So following up from this morning&amp;rsquo;s post, I have finished the first version of my python preflight script. It had a few complications but in the end it came out working well.
The problem As I have mentioned a few times on this blog, I have an issue when uploading new blog posts.</description>

      <title>Learning a new language</title>

      <description>The Python channel on Mastodon posted a link to a video about projects that you could use to inspire yourself while you try to learn Python. This was an interesting co-incidence since I was talking to one of the twins about this very thing this morning. They are learning Python because their favourite game uses it as the language to build mods.</description>

      <title>Combined Hugo Workflow</title>

      <description>I seem to have settled on using Hugo as my blogging platform. Since I have started using Alfred, I have put together one or two Workflows to help make it easier to create and edit posts. Those worked well but there were two problems. All of the paths in the scripts were hard-coded and the actions to create or edit content had different scripts for the two content types on my blog.</description>

      <title>Building the Tools page</title>

      <description>There is a new addition to the site. I put a link in the sidebar to a Tools page to list all of the Mac apps I make daily(ish) use of. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t difficult to add but it does include the first shortcode I have done for Hugo.
Shortcodes are a way to allow you to easily insert custom code and/or styles into your content.</description>

      <title>Front Matter CMS</title>

      <description>A while ago I was talking about possibly using Ulysses as my Markdown writing tool of choice. I tried using it to write a few posts to this blog but I ran into several issues. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into them in detail but just summarize them by saying that Ulysses will edit the content of the YAML front matter in your files in such a way that is contrary to the YAML specifications.</description>

      <title>Creating a Links page</title>

      <description>I joke with my friends that a programmer is a person who is a particular type of lazy. They will spend hours or even days on writing code or building a system so they never have to do a task twice. Regardless of the size of the task. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is a universal trait but it does describe how I often approach tasks that I know I will repeat again and again.</description>

      <title>Building with Hugo</title>

      <description>This site is built using a static site generator called Hugo. Hugo is a command line tool written using the Go language that takes Markdown or HTML pages and builds a website using a theme you specify. The resulting site consists of static HTML pages and so it loads ridiculously quickly and the pages are much smaller than pages built with a CMS.</description>
