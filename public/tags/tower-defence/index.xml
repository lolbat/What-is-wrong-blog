      <description>The Tower Defence games should have been the first warning.
I truly love TD games, especially Core Defense, and have had since I saw Fieldrunners on the iPad. Fieldrunners was followed by Fieldrunners 2 which was even better than the original and which I have played to completion several times.
I missed playing TD games when they first starting to be come a genre mostly because I didn&amp;rsquo;t really play a lot of Flash games and the games iterated so quickly that it was not a simple task to keep up with them.</description>
