      <description>The last few days have been taken up with work on my Textual app - Victor. I mentioned it in my last post and I have been typing away getting new features included. This is how the app currently looks.
The app will read in the path to your local Hugo install and then read through the content directory looking for Markdown files.</description>

      <description>I have continued to work on my Preflight script over the last day or two. After I posted about it I changed the output using the Rich library to add some command line pizzaz to it.
The new layout uses the Box layout object in Rich to draw an ASCII style box around the output.</description>

      <description>So following up from this morning&amp;rsquo;s post, I have finished the first version of my python preflight script. It had a few complications but in the end it came out working well.
The problem As I have mentioned a few times on this blog, I have an issue when uploading new blog posts.</description>
