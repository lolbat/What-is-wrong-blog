      <description>The last two weeks I have been working, on and off, to solve a problem I had with running a Shortcut in Hazel. I have quite a few rules in Hazel to process files as I download them. One of them attempted to rename a file and then move it. The files had tags in the filename that were separated by brackets. Items like the year of publication, author etc. The number of these tags isn&amp;rsquo;t always the same and so I needed a regular expression to snip all of them from the filename.</description>

      <description>From time to time I do anagrams. Nothing serious. I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t do it professionally but I have a fondness for making letters jump into new words. I have an odd relationship with words. I like them but I often have difficulty keeping the straight in my head. And my eyes and my brain sometimes disagree on what a series of words actually mean. So it is an odd fascination to have and an even odder skill to practice when you have several disadvantages at work making the process more difficult.</description>

      <description>I joke with my friends that a programmer is a person who is a particular type of lazy. They will spend hours or even days on writing code or building a system so they never have to do a task twice. Regardless of the size of the task. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is a universal trait but it does describe how I often approach tasks that I know I will repeat again and again.</description>
