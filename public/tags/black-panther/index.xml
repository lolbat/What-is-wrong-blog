      <description>After a significant wait I was finally able to watch Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. It is a long movie so I had to digest it in two sittings but it was well worth the time.
I will try to avoid discussing specific plot points but if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the film yet then you may want to wait to read this until later.
I am always impressed by Winston Duke&amp;rsquo;s acting skills.</description>
