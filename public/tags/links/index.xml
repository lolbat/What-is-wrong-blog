      <description>I joke with my friends that a programmer is a person who is a particular type of lazy. They will spend hours or even days on writing code or building a system so they never have to do a task twice. Regardless of the size of the task. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is a universal trait but it does describe how I often approach tasks that I know I will repeat again and again.</description>
