      <description>Sometimes the best way to learn how to use a new tool is to just dive in and see what it can do. I am working on a post about various automation tools and apps on the Mac at the moment. And as part of that, the folks at Running with Crayons sent me a key for the Powerpack in Alfred. Unlike LaunchBar or Raycast you can&amp;rsquo;t access the Workflow automation tools that come with Powerpack without a license.</description>

      <description>I am not sure if he came up with the term but, Cory Doctorow has certainly popularised Enshittification as well as providing the a handy list of the steps companies go through as they enshitiffy themselves. I have been thinking of that process a lot this week as I have been looking at various new software releases - Fig, Warp and Raycast 1. These are all attempts to modernise a facet of computing often overlooked (terminals and application launching) as well as adding team and enterprise components to them.</description>
