      <description>There is a very nice JavaScript library available that makes it easy to add a Share to Mastodon link to your website or blog. It is also on GitHub if that is how you roll. The library gives you a significant amount of flexibility to make the button display in a way that works with your site design. It also lets you host the code on your site, which is always a good option to have.</description>
