      <description>I like footnotes 1. Part of the blame for this has to lay with Terry Pratchett and his Discworld novels. Pratchett had a propensity for adding footnotes to his stories to, occasionally, add details to a line but, most often, to continue a joke or to sometimes ramble on for a half page.</description>
