      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t listen to many podcasts. My interests, even when taking my ADHD medication, tend to flit and bounce with the trajectory of a dust mote in a wind funnel. And so I haven&amp;rsquo;t really been interested in many topics long enough to develop a habit of listening to podcasts about them.</description>

      <description>From time to time I do anagrams. Nothing serious. I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t do it professionally but I have a fondness for making letters jump into new words. I have an odd relationship with words. I like them but I often have difficulty keeping the straight in my head. And my eyes and my brain sometimes disagree on what a series of words actually mean.</description>

      <description>I am, in a few respects, not the average Mac consumer. I tend to use my hardware until it breaks (I once dropped a Macbook Pro onto a floor and split the case) or it no longer works well for the tasks that I need it. And even then I try to reuse them.</description>

      <description>Last month I purchased a Bluetooth speaker to use around the house so I could play music while I worked. We have a very old CD player in the kitchen but the speakers are showing their age and sound rather muffled. It is also not very portable and so a new electronic doodad was purchased.</description>

      <description>The modern internet is the antithesis of curation. This is, for the most part, the common ground for the problems that haunt large web-sites such as YouTube, Facebook and others. They get so many submissions and at such a high rate that it is humanly impossible to sort them in any manner.</description>
