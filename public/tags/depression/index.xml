      <description>I have been creating a vault in Obsidian to contain some of my older bookmarks and links to pages for possible blog posts. It makes it easier to search them and I can also copy over the text from any webpages using the MarkDownload extension.
On a bit of a whim I added a daily notes page and a mood tracker.</description>

      <description>The Tower Defence games should have been the first warning.
I truly love TD games, especially Core Defense, and have had since I saw Fieldrunners on the iPad. Fieldrunners was followed by Fieldrunners 2 which was even better than the original and which I have played to completion several times.</description>
