      <description>Music on tap So I would prefer, if possible, to own my music. I have a longterm goal of building a decent sound system and buying some older jazz albums to listen to. Putting an Oscar Peterson album on and listening to it and making the timing of my morning work revolve around having to turn the album over each time it finishes playing.
That said, I recently subscribed to Apple Music and it is almost beyond contemplation how much music I have access to now.</description>
