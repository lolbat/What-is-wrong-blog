      <description>I am, in a few respects, not the average Mac consumer. I tend to use my hardware until it breaks (I once dropped a Macbook Pro onto a floor and split the case) or it no longer works well for the tasks that I need it. And even then I try to reuse them. The old iMac I used to do Flex (ugh!) and Director programming on is now in the basement running a Plex server for the family and acting as a print server.</description>
