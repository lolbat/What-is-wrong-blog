      <description>Writing with Markdown Some time ago I started doing most of my writing using Markdown. Almost everything I write end up online, either in a blog or website, and so it made sense to use a formatting system that was web-friendly. The more I used it though the more I wanted to use it everywhere. Being able to format you copy as you type, without having to move a mouse or use a menu, allows you to work without having to interrupt your thought process.</description>
