      <description>Sometimes the best way to learn how to use a new tool is to just dive in and see what it can do. I am working on a post about various automation tools and apps on the Mac at the moment. And as part of that, the folks at Running with Crayons sent me a key for the Powerpack in Alfred. Unlike LaunchBar or Raycast you can&amp;rsquo;t access the Workflow automation tools that come with Powerpack without a license.</description>

      <description>The last two weeks I have been working, on and off, to solve a problem I had with running a Shortcut in Hazel. I have quite a few rules in Hazel to process files as I download them. One of them attempted to rename a file and then move it. The files had tags in the filename that were separated by brackets. Items like the year of publication, author etc. The number of these tags isn&amp;rsquo;t always the same and so I needed a regular expression to snip all of them from the filename.</description>

      <title>Markdown writing tools</title>

      <description>Since starting to write using Markdown it has become, as I have commented, an obsession with me. I currently use Nota to write and organize all of my work and while it is quite good it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have everything that I want. Primarily, it currently doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any Shortcuts or AppleScript support which makes plugging it into an automated workflow trickier than needed. It is also an electron app and I like to find MacOS options when I can.</description>
