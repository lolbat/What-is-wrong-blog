      <description>Perhaps you have seen it happen online? Someone posts a comment and then appends the phrase &amp;lsquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a joke&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Humour for the humour impaired&amp;rsquo; or some variant. I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the people that post some deplorable remark and then try to dissemble their way clear of critique by claiming to be a humorist.</description>
