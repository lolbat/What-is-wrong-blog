      <description>Part of the Textual/Rich library ecosystem is a library called Rich CLI. It has a number of features but the one that has me most interested is its ability to export HTML and SVG versions of source code, Markdown and .csv files.
You can use this command line command
1rich -n -g _preflight_all.</description>
