  <p>I don&rsquo;t listen to many podcasts. My interests, even when taking my ADHD medication, tend to flit and bounce with the trajectory of a dust mote in a wind funnel. And so I haven&rsquo;t really been interested in many topics long enough to develop a habit of listening to podcasts about them. The other problem is that I was using <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-podcasts/">Apple&rsquo;s Podcast software</a> to listen to them. The product is, I think, emblematic of the overall problem with Apple&rsquo;s software. Music, TV+, Books, Podcasts and even Shortcuts are all applications developed by a large company with tens of thousands of employees and immense resources <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that are uniformly bad at doing their most basic functions.</p>
<p>Originally this post was going to be an exploration of why this is the case but I read something this morning that answered the question for me.</p>
<h2 id="for-us-not-for-you">For us, not for you</h2>
<p>John Gruber wrote a short piece this morning titled <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/ios_adware">Adware for Apple Services in iOS</a>. In it he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing that’s clear is that Apple sees Music and TV as Apple-service properties. Yes, you can use them for listening to your own music and watching your own video files, but first and foremost these are client apps to Apple’s Music and TV+ services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Earlier I was looking for an article where the author described all of the UI/UX problems with Apple Music. The writer had some very good points but I think that Gruber takes that article and creates a ten word consommé  that defines the problem.</p>
<p>Apple isn&rsquo;t creating applications for users anymore. They are creating applications to enable access to their own services and so the experience of their apps is informed not by their desire to make a god app but to make you engage with the service in a particular fashion.</p>
<h2 id="50000000-elvis-fans-cant-be-wrong">50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can&rsquo;t Be Wrong</h2>
<p>I started listening to a few podcasts this week <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and decided that there was no way that I was going to do so with Apple&rsquo;s application. I was going to do some searching to see what options there were but that was forestalled by someone mentioning <a href="https://mastodon.social/@marcoarment">Marco Arment&rsquo;s</a> <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast app</a> on Mastodon. I know Marco by reputation, and the folks recommending Overcast are all sensible folks, so I downloaded it and gave it a try.</p>
<p>People use the phrase &ldquo;the difference was night and day&rdquo; quite a bit but sometimes it fits. Overcast is everything that Podcasts isn&rsquo;t. Primarily, it is a usable application that makes it easy to listen to episodes and find new podcasts. Most of my issues with Podcasts were getting it to do, what I thought were, sensible things. Play the next episode even if it isn&rsquo;t numerically next. Put controls where I can reach them. Let me see more information about the episode easily.</p>
<p>These are all basic issues that don&rsquo;t arise when the developer doesn&rsquo;t have a interest in driving your attention and usage patterns in a particular direction. You could argue, that while this may be the case with Books, Music and TV+, that Apple doesn&rsquo;t have any service revenue from podcasts. That may be the case but I think that this method of application development has tainted the entire company <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="just-let-me">Just let me&hellip;</h2>
<p>I think that you know that you have run into this situation when you use software and find yourself asking &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t it just let me&hellip; ?&rdquo;. Apple software is plagued by this sort of issue. Why won&rsquo;t Books keep my files loaded locally? Why won&rsquo;t Music stop playing when it comes to the end of the album? Why won&rsquo;t Podcasts let me see all of the episodes for this podcast?</p>
<p>This is another example of the <a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/tiktoks-enshittification-bb3f5df91979">enshittification</a> process. Apple doesn&rsquo;t really have any competition for services on their platform <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and as a result has no market pressure to create a better experience for users. If you don&rsquo;t like the presumptions that are baked into an application like Music then you can try something else but anyone large enough to compete with Apple is also in their own enshittification cycle.</p>
<p>Thankfully there are still options available if you don&rsquo;t want to have your usage patterns dictated by shitty software. I&rsquo;ve mentioned Overcast but there are also applications like <a href="https://brushedtype.co/doppler/">Doppler</a> on the Mac and iOS <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.  Sadly the market for epub readers isn&rsquo;t equally blessed with good options.</p>
<h2 id="artisanal-software">Artisanal software</h2>
<p>I know that the word &lsquo;artisanal&rsquo; has <a href="http://artisanalpencilsharpening.com">gotten some bad press</a> in the past decade but I think it is appropriate in this sense. Folks like Marco Arment and Ed Wellbrock <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> write software from a different perspective and in a different market. They can&rsquo;t brush off complaints about the UI of their application and they also can&rsquo;t let long-standing bugs go uncorrected <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. I also suspect that they got involved in writing their software products because of their own interest in the area. You tend to not want to write a multi-function music player just for a lark <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Apple can afford the &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mouse#Design">Mickey has three fingers</a>&rsquo; approach to development due to its market size but small developers can&rsquo;t.</p>
<h3 id="an-aside-about-three-fingers">An aside about three fingers</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Mickey has three fingers&rsquo; was introduced to me by Brian Charles <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> who used it as a shorthand in cases when a product had visible flaws but those flaws weren&rsquo;t immediately apparent or online long enough for it to be a showstopper. Oh, and we need to ship tomorrow. I don&rsquo;t know where Brian picked up the phrase but it has stuck with me since then.</p>
<p>So Apple can give you &lsquo;Mickey has one finger&rsquo; software and it isn&rsquo;t a problem (for them) and there is little option for users. Apple&rsquo;s displacement in the market pushes most other developers out of the way and so I think it behooves us all to try to promote those applications that do actually care for their users and their interactions with their applications to promote them as much as possible.</p>
<p>I doubt that companies like Apple will suffer, or change course, if we try to actively promote better software alternatives but we can help foster and expand the market for those products and make it easier for people to find these better alternatives.</p>
