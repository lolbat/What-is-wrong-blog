  <p>Part of getting older is having to realise that times change and that you will invariably not understand what they become.  It is difficult to do. You stop being the generation that taste is made for and start becoming that old man who complains about the music playing in the bookstore. So I realise this and I accept it but there are instances when you wonder whether you are right or &ldquo;the kids&rdquo; are and it can be a difficult path to navigate.</p>
<p>I bring this up only because I was reading an article on Polygon yesterday that was commenting on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/10/23548431/marvel-snap-patch-notes-leader-nerf">pricing of the mobile game Marvel Snap</a>. I quite like Ash Parrish&rsquo;s work on the site and I wish that the editors there would let her write long form pieces and less clickbait BS but that is also probably just me being a old man. Also, and I digress, why the hell are so many sites posting articles about Marvel Snap? It isn&rsquo;t that good.</p>
<p>What made me have a WTF moment was a comment in the piece.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As mobile games go, Marvel Snap’s been really good about its monetization scheme. You spend $10 a month if you want that season’s new card/premium battle pass filled with premium prizes, which feels fairly standard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They do qualify the comment by saying &ldquo;As mobile games go,&rdquo; but the idea that paying $120 US a year to play a game like Marvel Snap is &ldquo;standard&rdquo; is shocking. I think that I spent less than $10 Cnd on <a href="https://zacgaming.wordpress.com/2023/01/06/core-defense-an-appreciation/">Core Defense and its single DLC</a> and while this is probably not a price that reflects that quality of the game (and a topic for another post?) it is a long jump from $10US  to $120US. And this is for a game that has ridiculously priced IAPs as well. Marvel Snap is yet another in a long, long, long, long line of &ldquo;games&rdquo; that have $100+ purchases you can make.</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img src="/images/am-i.jpg" alt="Am I wrong?"  width="600" />
</p></p>
<p>So it is at this point that I will hop over that line that separates me from the youth of today and proudly say  -</p>
<p><p class="md__image">
  <img src="/images/no-its.jpg" alt="No, it&amp;rsquo;s the children who are wrong"  width="600" />
</p></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s the children who are wrong&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I am not sure how today&rsquo;s generation of gamers have been made to think that this sort of pricing is in anyway appropriate but I think they all need to stop shelling out this sort of cash for games that are not only substandard but are specifically tailored to elicit purchases.</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t want to go on a rant. As incensed as I am at the platforms and companies that create these kid-friendly VLTs I am really more sad than anything. I have just great memories of the games I have played over the years and it feels as if we are letting generations of people get cheated of those same positive experiences. There are, to be sure, many games (mostly indie) that don&rsquo;t follow this monetization method. One of my kids is playing through <a href="https://www.humblegames.com/games/slaythespire/">Slay the Spire</a> and having a great time of it. I have also tried to make sure that I send them links to other games like <a href="https://tann.itch.io/slice-dice">Slice and Dice</a> so that they have positive gaming experiences.</p>
<p>So if you know of any yoots in your family or social circle do them a favour and make sure they get information about good games so that they avoid ending up thinking that paying a monthly subscription to a pile of crap like Marvel Snap is a good idea.</p>
