<p>The modern internet is the antithesis of curation. This is, for the most part, the common ground for the problems that haunt large web-sites such as YouTube, Facebook and others. They get so many submissions and at such a high rate that it is humanly impossible to sort them in any manner. Machine learning has been trotted out as a solution to at least the worse types of content being submitted by people but the problems of scale and a lack of human input extend to many services available online, not the least of which are maps.</p>
<h2 id="who-do-we-ask-for-help-when-we-dont-know-which-way-to-go">Who do we ask for help when we donâ€™t know which way to go?</h2>
<p>Most of these comments will be about the Apple Maps application. They will also apply to Google Maps which I use, from time to time, but with which I have far less exposure. Your experience may also differ from mine based on the types of things that you search for in Maps. I typically want to find a specific address in order to create a route to it or I search for local businesses that sell a particular type of product or provide a specific service. It is the latter that the rest of this post will discuss.</p>
<h3 id="we-need-your-help">We need your help!</h3>
<p>In the past I would use a search engine in order to look for local businesses. This had the benefit of typically providing me with decent results and often would also display the results on a web-based map so I could see where they were located geographically. Then search results started to become filled with bogus business listings that were <a href="https://searchengineland.com/millions-of-fake-google-maps-listings-hurt-real-business-and-consumers-318629">linked to  referral companies or scan artists</a>. A lot of these were listings for trades services, like plumbing, but it pointed to a problem that made me suspicious of search results in general. Google also started putting ads in their result both in the list of business results but also in the pop-ups for the businesses that it displayed on its map. I am at a loss to say which one of those two situations make their results the least useful.</p>
<p>I also started to use Apple Maps much more due to moving to a new city and not being familiar with the neighbourhoods and quite unable to navigate when driving or taking transit without some sort of map. I have also gotten older, and moved several times, and so my circle of friends with local knowledge has diminished and it is often easier to find a bookstore or craft store by searching on a map.</p>
<h2 id="great-you-found-it">Great! You found it!</h2>
<p>Most businesses in a mapping system appear to be defined by three sets of data. The geographic location, the business data (hours, phone etc) and a set of categories or keywords that describe the business. At least this is the user-facing data that you can see when looking at your map. I am almost certain that both Apple, Google and other sites have a swath of metadata that they use locally. Usually the business data is available for you to view when you look at a business but the keywords are usually not. I suspect that the keywords or categories assigned to a business are based on data that the business provides when it adds itself to a set of map data or perhaps added, via automation, from some other &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; source of data.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-click-around-to-discover-hidden-surprises">You can click around to discover hidden surprises</h3>
<p>These categories combine with the search tools in the application to provide you with results that, it is hoped, match your query. This is where a Map application like Google Maps or Apple Maps can dramatically fail. Many businesses, especially small local ones, either don&rsquo;t have accurate categories and tags or have incorrect ones added by users. Many large companies, like Walmart or large chain stores, have so many categories attached that they show up in every search.</p>
<p>The quality of the search engine can exaggerate this problem significantly. The search in Apple Maps appears to consider each word in a search as a distinct, element unlike Google Maps so looking for book stores in a city, for example, can often show you results in a different city if the names of a business match. In general I think that Google does a better job of limiting your search results to local businesses but I really don&rsquo;t feel comfortable having ads in my results and having Google store every business I look for.</p>
<h3 id="youll-never-find-it-now">Youâ€™ll never find it now!</h3>
<p>The combination of poor categorization and wonky search engines can lead to a situation where you are unable to find local shops. And in my case not being able to see shops that I found previously when doing a search. I am writing this at Xmas as we spend our first few months, and our first holiday season, in a new city. I really don&rsquo;t know where many good locations are for&hellip; well for anything. And being the father of teens with divergent interests and also quite non-standard interests have forced me to rely on Apple Maps more than I would typically and the results have been quite poor.</p>
<p>Sometimes the thing you want fits into a simple category. Books. Tires. Business suits. More often than not though what you are looking for seems, as a human being, to be a basic category but it seems to perplex a map application. What happens when you have a teen who is interested in <a href="https://www.fiberartsy.com/felting-a-beginners-guide/">felting</a>? A web search followed by a map lookup leads me to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=felting&amp;t=osx&amp;ia=web&amp;iaxm=maps">this</a> (you may have to click on the map icon). It is in the wrong city, the wrong country, a different continent and it doesn&rsquo;t even sell felting supplies. Google Maps is somewhat better (how could it be any worse?) but also includes results for a book store, Walmart, art supply stores, businesses that sell locally made crafts and a beer supply store.</p>
<p>It was the search for felting supplies that lead me not only on a merry chase to find the right keyword to use  but also to try to find a local crafting supply store that I had seen a few weeks previously. <code>Craft supplies</code> gave me all sorts of incorrect responses mostly due to the association of beer brewing with &lsquo;crafting&rsquo;. <code>Crafting Supplies</code> was an even worse search term as it left me with one result and that was for a store that sold farm supplies.</p>
<h2 id="come-on-say-it-with-us">Come on. Say it with us!</h2>
<p>At one point the entire web was nothing but curated links. People made lists of their favourite sites for a specific type of information and posted it to their web sites. A friend&rsquo;s list of fun sci-fi book sites would not contain links to extraneous information. Businesses were in the yellow pages and not online at all. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaVista">Alta Vista</a> started crawling those lists, and other web pages, to create one of the more popular early search engines.</p>
<p>The Yellow Pages were one of the more popular curated lists of business information and while it still exists online it has search results that are so chaotic that it makes you think it was randomly generated on <a href="https://perchance.org/dnd-buisness-generator">Perchance</a>. While it was available, and while search engines were still in their infancy and not being spammed by SEO farmers, it was an  invaluable resource. Some human being had taken a business submission and checked to see if it was legitimate and then put it into an appropriate category or categories that the Yellow Pages used.  Google probably did more to kill the Yellow Pages because, for a while at least, it provided the same details but quicker.</p>
<p>Where the Yellow Pages used to curate your local business results, I can think of no search engine or map application that does the same. If anything, it is more difficult to remove incorrect or bogus information from a search engine than it is to get new data added. Which leads to the difficulties I have been encountering. The scale of information that Apple and Google deal with means that humans don&rsquo;t verify the data and there is no human to contact to correct any mistakes.</p>
<h2 id="we-couldnt-have-done-it-without-you">We couldnâ€™t have done it without you!</h2>
<p>So is there a solution to this? I don&rsquo;t see one based on the lack of interest most of these companies have in hiring human beings to work. And the recently announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/15/meta-microsoft-aws-and-tomtom-launch-the-overture-maps-foundation-to-develop-interoperable-open-map-data/">Overture Maps Foundation</a> will probably make the situation worse as industry effort get splintered into competing map information systems.</p>
<p>Sadly it seems that the best solution for anyone looking to find a local store that sells felting supplies is to post to a subreddit. Or reach out and find a friend who might know. As long as they see your post on social media and the algorithm used to show them posts doesn&rsquo;t filter out your question.</p>
