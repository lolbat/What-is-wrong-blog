  <p>My grandmother, on my mother&rsquo;s side, passed away due to complications during surgery. It is a pleasing way to say that she was too old and the rigour of the procedure was too much for her system to bear. She was, if I recall correctly, 93 years of age and living with my uncle. They had a small farm in the interior of British Columbia, that my uncle maintained, which they moved to after selling a larger farm in northern BC.</p>
<p>The surgery was required because my grandmother fell and broke her leg. She was in bed at the time and got up to get something inconsequential and fell. A fall is never a predictable event. What seems like it might be a simple tumble to the floor can result in any combination of injuries as you pinball your way to horizontal. In the case of my grandmother it resulted in a broken leg. The break was severe enough that it required surgery. I wasn&rsquo;t part of the discussion surrounding the extent of her injuries but I suspect that the concern was that material from her broken bone was making its way into her bloodstream and would cause a potentially life-threatening case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_embolism_syndrome">fat embolism syndrome</a>. Whatever the root cause was, surgery was seen as a less risky procedure and so she made her way into the operating theatre.</p>
<p>People sometimes say that &ldquo;they didn&rsquo;t need to die&rdquo; and in my grandmother&rsquo;s situation that was certainly the case. She had got up to get something, again an inconsequential nothing, because she didn&rsquo;t want to wait until my uncle was free to get it for her. And based on years of experience with her I will go even further and say that she got up to get this nothing simply to use her retrieval of it as some small emotional shiv to needle my uncle with. This was how she approached almost everyone in her life. Arming herself with the tools she needed to gouge and manipulate them.</p>
<p>Her death passed through the family as a wave of relief more than anything. There was no service. No announcement even. A few phone calls were made and then. Nothing. I am not even sure if she was buried or cremated. I have to assume that she was cremated because on top of her other charms she was also notoriously cheap. Frugal is what you call it when people need to save money. She used money as a weapon. The year after she died my uncle took his first trip out of the country. Maybe even outside of the province of BC. That sums up her influence better than anything.</p>
<p>She passed and frankly no-one gave a shit. It is something that still haunts me. This has, for most of my life, been my fear. That when I was gone no-one would be bothered to shed a tear or share a story. An empty hall with deli platters on a table with the wrap still on them.</p>
<h2 id="summer-vacation">Summer vacation</h2>
<p>For ten years I would spend my summer at my grandparent&rsquo;s farm near Nanoose Bay on Vancouver Island. They had a forty acre farm and grew corn, wheat, vegetables and also had cows, sheep and chickens. My grandfather and uncle both had horses and the farm always had an assortment of dogs roaming the property. You could see the neighbouring farms but not hear them and so it was a tranquil place to spend a summer.</p>
<p>I had chores to do, more of them as I got older, and so I would gather eggs, clean out barns, feed pigs and horses and any number of things that needed to get done. I learned where molasses is made, watched my uncle jury-rig mechanical solutions to broken farm equipment and got to watch, and listen, to more animals than I would have at home. It could have been a wonderful set of memories other than having to spend months with my grandmother.</p>
<p>I recall one summer at a large family meal, another aunt and her husband had joined us, that my grandmother started a loud and raucous fight in the midst of dinner and then when the fight started to go against her she faked a heart attack. It was like something out of a soap opera but with less elegant furniture and more home cooking.</p>
<p>The best thing I can say is that I wasn&rsquo;t really important enough, or old enough, to justify much of her attention or schemes. I would occasionally be on the receiving end of it when my aunt Bernice would forget to do a chore and then blame me by saying that she had told me to do it. Sometimes I would annoy her and get assigned a chore like picking black currents or cleaning out the root cellar. Sometimes she would casually lie about some boon that I was going to receive only to take it away for some contrived reason.</p>
<p>I never really questioned the purpose of this holiday. I was just a kid. I figured that this was what people did. When I got older I realised that this wasn&rsquo;t the case. Most people didn&rsquo;t spend their entire summer separated from their family and friends. I don&rsquo;t resent the chores. I don&rsquo;t even really resent missing out on the adventures my friends had during the summer back home. I just could never understand why my mother would send me to spend so much time with a woman that she knew to be so cruel.</p>
<h2 id="an-opportunity-for-learning">An opportunity for learning</h2>
<p>I am not sure where I first encountered it, or how, but I have always firmly believed in Socrates&rsquo; dictate that &ldquo;the unexamined life is not worth living&rdquo;. The line is part of a larger comment Socrates makes in the <a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DApol.%3Asection%3D38b">Apology</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps someone might say, “Socrates, can you not go away from us and live quietly, without talking?” Now this is the hardest thing to make some of you believe. For if I say that such conduct would be disobedience to the gods and that therefore I cannot keep quiet, you will think I am jesting and will not believe me; and if again I say that to talk every day about virtue and the other things about which you hear me talking and examining myself and others is the greatest good to man, and that the unexamined life is not worth living, you will believe me still less. This is as I say, gentlemen, but it is not easy to convince you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me it has always meant that you need to examine your actions to see what it is that is causing you to behave the way you do. Or, in my case, careen through life from one accident to another. There have been many people in my life who have helped me with this process and also shown me the wisdom of following it. I have been lucky to have found people who cared enough for me to put up with my issues and help me work through them, face them and try to learn from them.</p>
<p>It is a course of action that I don&rsquo;t think my mother has ever embarked upon.</p>
<p>She left the farm as quickly as she could. Joining the Canadian Armed Forces to pursue a nursing career that lead her from Nanoose Bay to Churchill Manitoba and then to Prince George where she met and then married my father. I came along quite soon after and they both settled down to the normal experience of a middle-class nuclear family. My father did shift work and my mother worked at the local hospital and then, after I was born, took a 9-5 job working as a nurse-receptionist in a doctor&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>When I was in university I came across an essay, I think it was &ldquo;Joreen. The 51% Minority Group: A Statistical Essay&rdquo; by Jenny Knauss, that opened my eyes to much of the curious behaviour my mother had towards me due to my father&rsquo;s absence due to his shift work. It didn&rsquo;t explain everything though. I learned, too late unfortunately, to never reveal anything private or personal to my mother or it would be used against me at some later date and in some later argument. She was driven to fits of perfection that never seemed to come from a good place. They were manic. Christmas was two weeks of nervous energy as she worked to make it perfect despite having no real interested in the holiday. I can only imagine what Christmas with her mother would have been like. She tried to control my life in ways that were inappropriate and interfered in it to my detriment when she felt slighted.</p>
<p>I find it difficult to blame her for being the way she was and, to an extent, still is. I spent years seeing the effect that my grandmother had on my mother and her siblings even separated by hundreds of miles. Listening to arguments on the phone. Hearing them related over a dinner table. My mother was who she was because of the actions of my grandmother.</p>
<p>Sadly she lacked the tools or the awareness to try to change.</p>
<h2 id="only-a-phonecall-away">Only a phonecall away</h2>
<p>I spent fifteen years not talking to either of my parents due to my lack of desire to interact with her. My years away at university were difficult for both of us and while I tried to study and learn to live on my own she tried to maintain the control she had over me when I was still living at home. It lead to conflicts and acts of sabotage and after several years I decided that I didn&rsquo;t want to deal with her any more. I talked to my father about it and he, for whatever reason, decided to take a stand and tell me that I had to take them both as a group or not at all.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was trying to save the situation by drawing a line he didn&rsquo;t think I would cross. He didn&rsquo;t have the most well-developed emotional toolset and I think that he was largely unaware of how bad the situation was between my mother and I. I called his bluff though and that phone call was the last I would hear from him for fifteen years.</p>
<p>Dreams are many things. Random. Almost dissociative. Familiar people and friends inhabit other bodies but still remain themselves. Sometimes they are also representations of your fears. Anxiety dreams. Failing a test. Showing up for school naked. Losing your teeth. Losing a father.</p>
<p>In the end I didn&rsquo;t want to have my father die without talking to him again and so I made a call and started working on bridging the divide between us. It took some time but eventually my father was able to see my newborn twins before he passed away. I have a photo of him holding one of them, in our house in Vancouver, and he has such a wonderful smile. It is a moment that I didn&rsquo;t even know I wanted to have.</p>
<p>My dad and I also spent that weekend constantly correcting my mother when she mispronounced one of the twins names. She never said it correctly. Still hasn&rsquo;t. Fifteen years later.</p>
<h2 id="draußen-vor-der-tür">Draußen vor der Tür</h2>
<p>In the years since my father&rsquo;s death my mother has had a few moments of lucidity from which she has not offered apologies but reasons. She hated Christmas but my father loved it and so she tried to make it perfect. She has, in the slight breath of an aftermath of my grandmother&rsquo;s death, talked about how horrible a person she was and some of the things that she did.</p>
<p>In these conversations though she never saw herself. Never saw her doing the things she talked about her mother doing. She never saw that same death coming for her that grasped my grandmother. The wave of relief that will pass with her last breathe. She has a large number of friends and many relatives that she has visited with and calls regularly. She has an active circle of people who would probably miss her. I won&rsquo;t though.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hate her. I don&rsquo;t even dislike her. I just don&rsquo;t have any positive connection with her and what remains is a sense of responsibility. A familial duty that arose somehow and from somewhere that I don&rsquo;t understand. I have kept my own children as far away from her as I can politely manage. I think a braver person would just pull the cord and walk away from her but I am still in, no small amount, of fear of her. I don&rsquo;t actually think that anything would come of it but fear is the only excuse I can proffer. In the end I am still a small scared child wanting to get her love and approval and while I know I can never get it, that it may not even be there to obtain, I am still frightened.</p>
<p>She remains in my life and is the steady example to me of what happens when you lead that unexamined life. Passing on the harsh lessons of your childhood to your own children and not realising it. Making the same mistakes, wanting the same control and driving the same people away from you. I am far from perfect. I am not the best person I could be. I would like to think though that when I pass at least my family will be aggrieved. It won&rsquo;t be much but it will be an improvement.</p>
