			 I did a fair bit of work on my preflight app/command last night. Primarily it was to add an argument to the command line to allow the user to add config data to the code so it knows where the user’s Hugo installation is.
I was reading through the Python Docs for argparse options as I was trying to make sure that the code would display help even if it was missing configuration data.

			 I spent yesterday, and a bit of today, doing some work on my blog to add some tweaks to a few features that had been irritating me but clearly not enough to have done anything about it sooner. The recent posts list is now in a smaller font size and has bullets to make each post distinct.

			 A while ago, I wrote about an Alfred Workflow to open pages in an Obsidian Vault. It was part of the start of a more robust Workflow to let me store all of my bookmarks in Obsidian instead of my browser. I posted about it but I never put the Workflow on Github as I originally planned.

			 The last few days have been taken up with work on my Textual app - Victor. I mentioned it in my last post and I have been typing away getting new features included. This is how the app currently looks.
The app will read in the path to your local Hugo install and then read through the content directory looking for Markdown files.

			 Today has been a day filled with writing and rewriting code. For the last few days I have bashing around in a command line UI system called Textual. It is a Python based Rapid Application Development framework that lets you build TUI applications. Terminal User Interface. If it isn’t the geekiest thing I have ever done I don’t know what is.

On the Mac the command line tools are accessed via an executable inside the Inskscape .app package. It doesn’t load any binaries so you have to call it with the path to the Inkscape application.
