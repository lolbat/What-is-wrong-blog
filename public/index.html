        I am, in a few respects, not the average Mac consumer. I tend to use my hardware until it breaks (I once dropped a Macbook Pro onto a floor and split the case) or it no longer works well for the tasks that I need it. And even then I try to reuse them. The old iMac I used to do Flex (ugh!) and Director programming on is now in the basement running a Plex server for the family and acting as a print server.

        Since starting to write using Markdown it has become, as I have commented, an obsession with me. I currently use Nota to write and organize all of my work and while it is quite good it doesn&rsquo;t have everything that I want. Primarily, it currently doesn&rsquo;t have any Shortcuts or AppleScript support which makes plugging it into an automated workflow trickier than needed. It is also an electron app and I like to find MacOS options when I can.

        This site is built using a static site generator called Hugo. Hugo is a command line tool written using the Go language that takes Markdown or HTML pages and builds a website using a theme you specify. The resulting site consists of static HTML pages and so it loads ridiculously quickly and the pages are much smaller than pages built with a CMS.
I am using a theme for the site based on the Poison theme which is itself based on another theme called Hyde.

        If you are here reading this post then you have found my blog in its new home. I was, until yesterday, using Wordpress as a hosting service but have moved all of my recent writing to this new location. There are two primary reasons for this.
I might still be using Wordpress if I hadnâ€™t made the mistake of viewing the site without my ad blocker and saw these:
At the bottom of every blog post were a series of ads from companies such as Outbrain.

        Last month I purchased a Bluetooth speaker to use around the house so I could play music while I worked. We have a very old CD player in the kitchen but the speakers are showing their age and sound rather muffled. It is also not very portable and so a new electronic doodad was purchased. I bought it at Best Buy which is a Canadian electronics chain store. I spent quite a bit of time looking for a locally owned store that sold them but wasn&rsquo;t able to find one.

        My grandmother, on my mother&rsquo;s side, passed away due to complications during surgery. It is a pleasing way to say that she was too old and the rigour of the procedure was too much for her system to bear. She was, if I recall correctly, 93 years of age and living with my uncle. They had a small farm in the interior of British Columbia, that my uncle maintained, which they moved to after selling a larger farm in northern BC.

        Part of getting older is having to realise that times change and that you will invariably not understand what they become. It is difficult to do. You stop being the generation that taste is made for and start becoming that old man who complains about the music playing in the bookstore. So I realise this and I accept it but there are instances when you wonder whether you are right or &ldquo;the kids&rdquo; are and it can be a difficult path to navigate.

        The Tower Defence games should have been the first warning.
I truly love TD games, especially Core Defense, and have had since I saw Fieldrunners on the iPad. Fieldrunners was followed by Fieldrunners 2 which was even better than the original and which I have played to completion several times.
I missed playing TD games when they first starting to be come a genre mostly because I didn&rsquo;t really play a lot of Flash games and the games iterated so quickly that it was not a simple task to keep up with them.

        The modern internet is the antithesis of curation. This is, for the most part, the common ground for the problems that haunt large web-sites such as YouTube, Facebook and others. They get so many submissions and at such a high rate that it is humanly impossible to sort them in any manner. Machine learning has been trotted out as a solution to at least the worse types of content being submitted by people but the problems of scale and a lack of human input extend to many services available online, not the least of which are maps.

        Star light, star bright,
First star I see tonight;
I wish I may, I wish I might
Know if you are a Starlink satellite
2022 has been a year defined by corporations releasing products and services without any thought given to consequences or even such piffling factors as ethics and morality. SpaceX, an Elon Musk company, pushed 100s of satellites into the sky causing havoc for earthbound astronomers. The company has plans for a total of 2700 low-earth orbit satellites which is slightly more than 50% of the existing number of objects in low-earth orbit.
