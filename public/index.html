        Sometimes the best way to learn how to use a new tool is to just dive in and see what it can do. I am working on a post about various automation tools and apps on the Mac at the moment. And as part of that, the folks at Running with Crayons sent me a key for the Powerpack in Alfred. Unlike LaunchBar or Raycast you can&rsquo;t access the Workflow automation tools that come with Powerpack without a license.

        The underpinnings of an operating system can be mysterious and complex. This typically isn&rsquo;t a problem if the system is working correctly as you will never need to worry yourself with any of those messy parts. When they start to fail you will, unfortunately, need to dig underneath the calm exterior of your OS into the largely text-based underpinnings that make it work. It is never pretty.
Our story begins I wanted to do a very simple thing in Alfred.

        I am not sure if he came up with the term but, Cory Doctorow has certainly popularised Enshittification as well as providing the a handy list of the steps companies go through as they enshitiffy themselves. I have been thinking of that process a lot this week as I have been looking at various new software releases - Fig, Warp and Raycast 1. These are all attempts to modernise a facet of computing often overlooked (terminals and application launching) as well as adding team and enterprise components to them.

        You may be familiar with the name Taboola. They are a US-based advertising agency that became infamous for plastering the internet with &ldquo;Recommended&rdquo; links at the end of news articles and online content. You could lose belly fat by not eating one fruit. Or a politician was suggesting you buy gold. Or you would be surprised by how some celebrity looked before they were famous. Perhaps you might be interested in one weird trick?

        The last two weeks I have been working, on and off, to solve a problem I had with running a Shortcut in Hazel. I have quite a few rules in Hazel to process files as I download them. One of them attempted to rename a file and then move it. The files had tags in the filename that were separated by brackets. Items like the year of publication, author etc. The number of these tags isn&rsquo;t always the same and so I needed a regular expression to snip all of them from the filename.

        A while ago I was talking about possibly using Ulysses as my Markdown writing tool of choice. I tried using it to write a few posts to this blog but I ran into several issues. I won&rsquo;t go into them in detail but just summarize them by saying that Ulysses will edit the content of the YAML front matter in your files in such a way that is contrary to the YAML specifications.

        From time to time I do anagrams. Nothing serious. I certainly don&rsquo;t do it professionally but I have a fondness for making letters jump into new words. I have an odd relationship with words. I like them but I often have difficulty keeping the straight in my head. And my eyes and my brain sometimes disagree on what a series of words actually mean. So it is an odd fascination to have and an even odder skill to practice when you have several disadvantages at work making the process more difficult.
